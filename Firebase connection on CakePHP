# Cloud Firestore for CakePHP


### Installation

To begin, install the preferred dependency manager for PHP, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Now to install just this component:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud-firestore
```

Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud
```

This component requires the gRPC extension. Please see our [gRPC installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc)
for more information on how to configure the extension.



### Sample

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Google\Cloud\Firestore\FirestoreClient;

$firestore = new FirestoreClient([
  'keyFilePath' => 'path/to/json'
]);

$collectionReference = $firestore->collection('Users');
$documentReference = $collectionReference->document($userId);
$snapshot = $documentReference->snapshot();

echo "Hello " . $snapshot['firstName'];
```

### To Get Reference as Array

```php
  $snapshot->data()
```
